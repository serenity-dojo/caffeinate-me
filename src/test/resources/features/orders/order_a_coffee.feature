Feature: Order a coffee

  In order to save time when I pick up my morning coffee
  As a coffee love
  I want to be able to order my coffee in advance

  Background:
    Given Cathy is a CaffeinateMe customer

Rule: Orders placed close to the store should be considered as Urgent
  Example: Buyer orders a coffee when they are close to the coffee shop
    Given Cathy is 100 metres from the coffee shop
    When Cathy orders a "large cappuccino"
    Then Barry should receive the order
    And Barry should know that the order is Urgent


  Example: Buyer orders a coffee when they are 50 metres away from the shop
    Given Cathy is 50 metres from the coffee shop
    When Cathy orders a "large cappuccino"
    Then Barry should receive the order
    And Barry should know that the order is Urgent

  Scenario: Buyer orders a coffee when they are far to the shop
    Given Cathy is 300 metres from the coffee shop
    When Cathy orders a "large Cappuccino"
    Then Barry should receive the order
    And Barry should know that the order is Normal

 Rule: Buyers can specify their preferences when they order
  Example: Buyers can add a comment with their order
    Given Cathy orders a "large cappuccino" with a comment "Double sugar"
    Then Barry should receive the order
    And the order should have the comment "Double sugar"


  Rule: Buyers can order many items in the same order
    Example: A buyer orders two items in the same order
      When Cathy places an order for the following items:
        | Product          | Quantity |
        | Large cappuccino | 1        |
        | Espresso         | 2        |
      Then Barry should receive the order
      And the order should contain 2 line items
